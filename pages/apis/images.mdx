# Image API

[Thaldrin]'s random Image API is currently only supported in the [Yiff] NPM Module or through direct requests

The **current** base url for ALL requests is `thaldr.in/api/v1/`

## Categories
To see all available categories, visit `thaldr.in/api/v1/categories`

We currently do not block User-Agents, but we may do so in the future.\
Make sure to send a proper User-Agent when requesting anything! \
Something like `Project/version (link to project)`

## Example Code
```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

axios({
	method: "GET",
	url: `https://thaldr.in/api/v1/categories/${ENDPOINT}`,
	headers: {
		"User-Agent": `Project/version (link to project)`,
		"Authorization": `<Your API Key>`
	}
})

```
